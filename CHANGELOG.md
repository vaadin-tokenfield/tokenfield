# Changelog

All notable changes to TokenField Reloaded are documented here.

## [7.0.2] - Unreleased

First release of the fork. Forked from the original TokenField add-on's last upstream release,
7.0.1 (2013-02-14, by Marc Englund), and migrated from Google Code to GitHub.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Maven groupId changed from `org.vaadin.addons` to `org.vaadin.addons.tokenfield`.
  Published as a new Vaadin Directory listing, "TokenField Reloaded" — this fork does not own and
  cannot update the original "TokenField" listing.
- Rebuilt on Vaadin 7.7.17 and Java 8.

### Added

- Add Maven-based Project packaging
- Maven Central release path (GPG signing and Central Portal publishing), in addition to the
  Directory ZIP bundle.
- JUnit 5 unit test suite (114 tests) covering container handling, buffering, read-only state,
  insert position, button configuration, delegation, sizing, captions/icons, layout swapping,
  the delete-key path, and UI input behavior.
- JaCoCo coverage reporting and a build-failing line-coverage threshold (90%) on the add-on module.
- Playwright for Java browser integration tests (26 tests across all five demo panels), run under
  `maven-failsafe-plugin` against a `jetty-maven-plugin`-managed instance of the demo as part of
  `mvn verify` (`-DskipITs=false`; on by default in CI). Replaces an earlier, disconnected
  TypeScript/Node Playwright suite that never ran in CI and required a manually pre-started server.

### Fixed

- Add missing Apache license file headers
- Add-on JAR manifest `Implementation-Title` now matches the new Directory listing name.
- Add-on JAR no longer carries an unresolvable `Class-Path` manifest entry.
- Directory ZIP manifest now includes `Vaadin-Widgetsets` and `Vaadin-License-File`.
- Assembly ZIP build no longer overwrites the JAR as the project's main artifact.
- Fixed "Layout and InsertPosition" Demo

## [7.0.1]

- Updated to work with 7.0 final. 
- Note: CSS selectors are made stronger, you might have to do the same if you have styled TokenField.

## [7.0.0]

- Converted to work with Vaadin 7. 
- Added a possibility to customize the adding of new items to the dropdown.
